Abstract
This thesis investigates the relationship between homeowners’ expectations regarding future home prices and their decision to transition from owning to renting. Utilizing data from the DNB Household Survey, I do not find a significant relationship between these variables. Instead, I find evidence suggesting that households experiencing a divorce or a change in the number of household members are more likely to transition from owning to renting. I explore potential explanations for this weak relationship, such as frictions related to family composition, confidence, or education, but find no strong evidence supporting the role of these frictions on the housing market. I also attempt to minimize the impact of measurement error on the estimates. While I find that measurement error accounts for a non-trivial component of the weak relationship, it cannot explain it alone. Finally, I explore whether rational inattention can account for the limited sensitivity of the average homeowner and find some evidence supporting this hypothesis. These findings leave room for future research exploring rational inattention on the housing market and for research using larger surveys that can be combined with administrative data.
